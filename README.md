Notes About the 'Airport Details csv' Project:

I wanted to combine data from multiple sources about the different relevant airports. I am not sure yet whether or not I will post the project for which this updated dataframe is intended. 
 
With this project, I was able to test out the read_html functin to retrieve data from a chart on a Wikipedia page. I was also able to merge multiple dataframes together. All together, some great practice!

Notes about 'Merging Multiple DataFrames for Added Information' & 'Practice with GroupBy Function.ipynb' Projects:

This is some additional practice working with merging dataframes as well as using groupBy functionality. I found the dataset on kaggle (link is provided in the project).
