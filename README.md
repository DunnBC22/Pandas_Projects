Notes About the 'Airport Details csv' Project

I wanted to combine data from multiple sources about the different relevant airports. I am not sure yet whether or not I will post the project for which this updated dataframe is intended. 
 
With this project, I was able to test out the read_html functin to retrieve data from a chart on a Wikipedia page. I was also able to merge multiple dataframes together. All together, some great practice!
